## :scroll: Description
The implemented design of the Android Dev Challenge Week 3.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I really like working with Jetpack Compose. One thing that I tried with this app is everything with the preview in Android Studio. At the end I deployed it to a phone and had to do some minor tweaks.
